<h2>Recommandations</h2>
<p>The top three pizzas sold were all in chicken category, and most of the bottom pizzas were all in veggie category. Therefore, consider to add more chicken pizzas and remove unpopular veggie pizzas. Bottom hours were 9h and 23h with sales of $304 and $1121, which was way lower than the average hourly sales of $54524. During the two hours, the restaurant was not making much money, so I recommend to open the store starting at 11:00 and close the store at 22h to save some cost. For pizza sizes, XL and XXL size were not doing much sales, I recommend to stop making pizzas in XL and XXL to save some cost and improving profits. </p>
